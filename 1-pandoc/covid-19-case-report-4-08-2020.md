These data are current as of 4/8/2020 and subject to change.

The following caveats apply to these data:

1.  Information on race and ethnicity is collected and reported by
    multiple entities and may or may not reflect self-report by the
    individual case.

2.  If no information is provided by any reporter on a case’s race or
    ethnicity, DPH classifies it as missing.

3.  A classification of unknown indicates the reporter did not know the
    race and ethnicity of the individual, the individual refused to
    provide information, or that the originating reporting system does
    not capture the information.

4.  Other indicates multiple races or that the originating reporting
    system does not capture the information

**Note:** COVID-19 testing is currently conducted by dozens of private
laboratories, hospitals, and other partners and the Department of Public
Health is working with these organizations to improve data reporting by
race and ethnicity, to better understand where, and on whom, the burden
of illness is falling so the Commonwealth can respond more effectively.
