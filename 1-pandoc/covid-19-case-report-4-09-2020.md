These data are current as of 4/9/2020 and subject to change.

The following caveats apply to these data:

1.  Information on race and ethnicity is collected and reported by
    multiple entities and may or may not reflect self-report by the
    individual case.

2.  If no information is provided by any reporter on a case’s race or
    ethnicity, DPH classifies it as “missing.”

3.  A classification of “unknown” indicates the reporter did not know
    the race and ethnicity of the individual, the individual refused to
    provide information, or that the originating reporting system does
    not capture the information.

4.  “Other” indicates multiple races or that the originating reporting
    system does not capture the information

**Note:** DPH has issued an emergency order regarding efforts to
collect complete demographic information on patients with confirmed or
suspected COVID-19.View the order
