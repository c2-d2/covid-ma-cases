These data are current as of 4/12/2020 at 10:00 AM and subject to
change.

The following caveats apply to these data:

1.  Information on race and ethnicity is collected and reported by
    multiple entities and may or may not reflect self-report by the
    individual case.

2.  If no information is provided by any reporter on a case’s race or
    ethnicity, DPH classifies it as missing.

3.  A classification of unknown indicates the reporter did not know the
    race and ethnicity of the individual, the individual refused to
    provide information, or that the originating reporting system does
    not capture the information.

4.  Other indicates multiple races or that the originating reporting
    system does not capture the information.

**Note:** DPH has issued an [emergency
order](https://www.mass.gov/doc/covid-data-reporting-order/download)
regarding efforts to collect complete demographic information on
patients with confirmed or suspected COVID-19.
